# Taskfy App
> ToDo app to manage your daily tasks.

This project was developed to study about state management using [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) and third part API consumption with Flutter. Feel free to look the [Taskfy API](https://github.com/thierryoliveira/taskfy_api), the project I developed too as this app backend.

## Review
To develop this, I used the [GetX Pattern](https://kauemurakami.github.io/getx_pattern/) organizated by modules.

## Important

No changes are needed to run this app, but if you are running a local backend API, do you need to change the "baseURL" inside of provider files.


## Release History

* 1.0.0
    * CHANGE: Add application with authentication features like sign in and sign up and also the task features like create, delete and view.
